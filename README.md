# Programs
1. Factorial:
Calculating factorial of any number upto 100..
The program can calculate factorial of any number whose factorial's length is less than 200 digits. 

2. Trailing_zeroes:
Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of an input number.
The actual factorial is not needed to be calculated to find the number of trailing zeroes.

3. Super_ASCII:
A string is Super ASCII, if all the characters in the string occur exactly as many times as their ASCII values, else they don't occur. Here ASCII value of 'a' is assumed to be 1, b=2, c=3 and so on. The program calculates if the string is Super ASCII or not and prints the result. Can work for the specified array size of variable 'input'.

4. Longest_subsequence:
The longest continuous sub-sequence of the sequence: 90 12 14 15 70 13 72 74 73 75 71 will be:
70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 of length 5. Here, one more continuous sub-sequence, i.e. 12, 13, 14, 15 is present. But, it is not the longest one in the given sequence. The aim of the program is to display the longest sub-sequence alongwith its length.
